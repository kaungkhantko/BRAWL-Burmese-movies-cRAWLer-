* **Project Name**: Burmese Movies Catalogue
* **Version**: 1.1
* **Owner**: Kaung Khant Ko
* **Last Updated**: 2025-05-08

### üéØ Mission

To create a **comprehensive and searchable catalogue of Burmese films**, including feature films, documentaries, and series, to **support academic research** and **promote the Burmese film industry**.

---

## üë• Intended Users & Outcomes

### Primary Users:

* General Public
* Researchers and Scholars
* Internal Analytics and Reporting Teams

### Key Outcomes:

* Searchable metadata catalogue of Burmese-related audiovisual works
* Exportable dataset for academic research
* Future-proofed API integration
* Human validation and enrichment workflow for data integrity

---

## üé¨ Content Scope

### Included Media Types:

* Feature Films
* Documentaries
* TV Series
* Short Films

### Excluded:

* User-generated content (e.g., YouTube clips, TikToks)

### Inclusion Criteria:

* Language: Burmese, Zawgyi, or Unicode Mixed
* Origin: Myanmar productions, co-productions, or significant Burmese creative involvement
* Cast/Director: Must include at least one Burmese national

### Field Requirements:

* **Required**: `title`
* **Optional**: year, director, cast, genre, synopsis, poster URL, awards, reviews, production company, runtime, language, subtitles, country, related links

**Note**: Entries with only a title are accepted but must be flagged for future enrichment. All fields must store their **individual source provenance**.

## üîç Source Strategy

### Discovery Methods:

* IMDb, TMDb, Wikipedia
* Burmese film databases
* Wathan Film Festival, Asian Film Archive

### Supported Source Types:

* Streaming sites
* News portals
* Wiki-style directories
* Blogspot / WordPress pages
* Social media (Facebook, Instagram)
* Film awards and festival listings
* Professional film associations

### Technical Support:

* Multilingual text handling
* Unicode normalization (Zawgyi/Unicode aware)

---

## üï∏ Crawl Strategy

* Weekly refresh cycles
* Max 500 pages per domain
* Scale target: 50,000+ pages
* Domain-specific JS rendering via Selenium (only when needed)
* Deep link-following allowed within domain boundaries
* Deduplication and crawl resume functionality
* `MOCK_MODE` flag for full offline testing
* Merging logic for multi-source film entries

---

## ‚úÖ Data Validation & Enrichment

* Prioritize accuracy over completeness
* Allow partial records
* Each field must include a source tag
* Human review loop required for high-impact fields
* Retry queues for failed crawls
* Editor-facing tools to enable metadata enrichment and correction

---

## üõ° Compliance

* Respects `robots.txt`
* No exemptions for blocked domains
* Posters and images must be copyright-safe
* Custom user-agent: `BRAWL-Crawler (+contact_url)`

---

## üîÅ Extensibility & Future-Proofing

### Future Expansion:

* Game metadata cataloguing
* Tech stack profiling (e.g., StackShare scraping)
* Cross-referencing with IMDb/TMDb datasets

### Downstream Features:

* Search frontend
* Recommendation engine
* Trend analytics dashboard

### Schema Design:

* Modular field sets per domain (e.g., `film_fields`, `game_fields`)

---

## üöÄ Deployment & API Strategy

### Environments:

* Development: Localhost (with mock mode)
* Production: Cloud or VPS environment

### Job Scheduling:

* Cron-based for now
* Kubernetes batch job support (future)

### API Strategy:

* Backend-first, REST API with optional PATCH endpoints
* Designed to support OpenAPI spec and editing UI
