  goal: >
    Prove end-to-end film processing from saved HTML fixtures to indexed,
    validated film entries using MOCK_MODE. Build confidence in the core loop:
    extract ➜ validate ➜ merge ➜ index ➜ search.

  success_criteria:
    - "2+ real HTML fixtures processed in MOCK_MODE"
    - "Extracted fields conform to Pydantic schema"
    - "Provenance is captured and inspectable"
    - "Merged entries are passed to SearchIndexer"
    - "Data is queryable via FilmAPI or direct index"
