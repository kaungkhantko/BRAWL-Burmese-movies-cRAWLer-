- component: MoviesSpider vs Orchestrator
  category: Architecture
  severity: high
  impact: Overlapping responsibilities blur ownership; harder to unit-test
  suggestion: Let Orchestrator own classification/extraction; Spider handles I/O only
  status: todo
  github_issue: 24
- component: PageClassifier (rule-based)
  category: Architecture
  severity: medium
  impact: Static thresholds break on layout shifts; brittle at scale
  suggestion: Add rule-firing telemetry + prepare dataset for lightweight ML fallback
  status: todo
  github_issue: 25
- component: Site Profiles
  category: Architecture
  severity: medium
  impact: Treating every site identically causes unnecessary fallbacks & noise
  suggestion: YAML/JSON "site profile" layer (selectors, JS flag, field map, rate limit)
  status: todo
  github_issue: 26
- component: Crawl Resume / Checkpointing
  category: Architecture
  severity: medium
  impact: Long jobs lose progress on crash; duplicates on restart
  suggestion: Persist crawl state (scrapy-checkpoint or Redis queue) for resume
  status: todo
  github_issue: 27
- component: SeleniumManager coupling
  category: Performance
  severity: high
  impact: JS rendering dominates crawl time & RAM; hard to parallelise
  suggestion: Make JS rendering configurable per-domain; evaluate Playwright async pool
  status: todo
  github_issue: 28
- component: Async I/O & Concurrency tuning
  category: Performance
  severity: high
  impact: Sequential blocking lowers throughput; won't meet daily re-crawl SLA
  suggestion: Use asyncio-driven renderer workers; tune CONCURRENT_REQUESTS, auto-throttle
  status: todo
  github_issue: 29
- component: Deduplication / Caching (URLs & Items)
  category: Performance
  severity: medium
  impact: Redundant fetches waste bandwidth; duplicates inflate dataset
  suggestion: Enable scrapy-deltafetch or hash-based URL cache + item fingerprinting
  status: todo
  github_issue: 30
- component: Memory Footprint on Large Pages
  category: Performance
  severity: low
  impact: Big HTML (video portals) can OOM small containers
  suggestion: Stream parse with lxml.iterparse or size guard before DOM-heavy ops
  status: todo
  github_issue: 31
- component: FieldExtractor._match_field
  category: DataQuality
  severity: high
  impact: Fuzzy mis-mapping leaks incorrect labels (director → cast, etc.)
  suggestion: Threshold ≥ 80; log scores; switch fuzzywuzzy ➜ rapidfuzz for speed
  status: todo
  github_issue: 32
- component: CandidateExtractor recall/precision
  category: DataQuality
  severity: medium
  impact: Noisy blocks pass to Trafilatura, increasing false positives
  suggestion: Pre-filter blocks lacking ≥2 core fields (title/year/director)
  status: todo
  github_issue: 33
- component: Pipeline Validation & Quality Metrics
  category: DataQuality
  severity: medium
  impact: Silent schema drift or empty fields degrade downstream analytics
  suggestion: Add "data quality monitor" step (null %, value ranges, year sanity) + Prometheus gauges
  status: todo
  github_issue: 34
- component: Provenance Tracking
  category: DataQuality
  severity: low
  impact: Hard to audit errors without source HTML/context
  suggestion: Store raw HTML hash + selector paths alongside parsed item
  status: todo
  github_issue: 35
- component: Logging & Metrics
  category: Ops
  severity: high
  impact: Limited visibility into crawl health, error spikes, rule misfires
  suggestion: Structured JSON logs, Prometheus counters, Grafana dashboard
  status: todo
  github_issue: 36
- component: Retry / Backoff Strategy
  category: Ops
  severity: medium
  impact: Transient 5xx or 429 may lead to unnecessary failures
  suggestion: Exponential backoff + circuit-breaker on domain; alert on >N retries
  status: todo
  github_issue: 37
- component: Mock Mode Maintenance
  category: Ops
  severity: low
  impact: Fixtures grow stale; tests diverge from prod reality
  suggestion: Provide "fixture refresh" script + CI job to flag diff vs live HTML
  status: todo
  github_issue: 38
- component: Multilingual & Encoding Tests
  category: Testing
  severity: medium
  impact: UTF-8/Unicode edge cases break extraction on Burmese + mixed sites
  suggestion: Parametrised pytest fixtures with varied encodings; random sample fuzzing
  status: todo
  github_issue: 39
- component: JavaScript-heavy Site Tests
  category: Testing
  severity: low
  impact: Selenium logic untested in headless CI; regressions unnoticed
  suggestion: GitHub Actions parallel job with xvfb / Playwright for JS examples
  status: todo
  github_issue: 40
- component: Coverage & Static Analysis
  category: Testing
  severity: low
  impact: Hidden dead code and style drift
  suggestion: Enforce ≥85 % coverage; run ruff/black/mypy in pipeline
  status: todo
  github_issue: 41
- component: robots.txt / Policy Compliance
  category: Security
  severity: medium
  impact: Legal or ethical violations against target sites
  suggestion: Obey robots.txt + custom per-site exemptions list + user-agent string
  status: todo
  github_issue: 42
- component: Request Rate-Limiting & IP Rotation
  category: Security
  severity: low
  impact: Gets blocked or captchas triggered
  suggestion: Polite delay per domain; rotating proxy pool w/ respect for TOS
  status: todo
  github_issue: 43
- component: Library Versions & CVE Scanning
  category: Dependency
  severity: medium
  impact: Outdated Selenium / fuzzywuzzy pose security + performance risks
  suggestion: Pin in requirements-lock; dependabot + safety check in CI
  status: todo
  github_issue: 44
- component: Schema Versioning & Migrations
  category: Storage
  severity: low
  impact: Breaking changes require backfills and API bumps
  suggestion: Adopt semantic version on MovieItem; migration scripts for DB
  status: todo
  github_issue: 45
- component: Incremental Upserts
  category: Storage
  severity: low
  impact: Full re-imports overwrite manual corrections
  suggestion: Upsert by (title, year) PK; keep "last_seen" + "changed" timestamps
  status: todo
  github_issue: 46
- component: Date / Number Localisation
  category: i18n
  severity: low
  impact: Different calendars or Burmese numerals mis-parsed
  suggestion: Use dateparser with "languages=['my', 'en']"; normalise numerals
  status: todo
  github_issue: 47
